# /sync - Sync Project Rules & Skills

**Sync custom rules and skills with the current codebase.** Reads existing rules/skills, explores code patterns, identifies gaps, updates documentation, creates new skills.

**Flow:** Read existing → Index → Explore → Compare → Sync project/MCP/skills → Discover new rules/skills → Summary

**Team sharing:** Use the Teams page in the Console dashboard to push/pull assets via sx.

---

## Phase 0: Reference

### Guidelines

- **Always use AskUserQuestion** when asking the user anything
- **Read before writing** — check existing rules before creating
- **Write concise rules** — every word costs tokens in context
- **Idempotent** — running multiple times produces consistent results

### Project Slug

Derive the project slug from the git repo or directory name. Use it as a prefix for ALL created rules and skills to avoid name collisions across repositories.

```bash
# Derive slug: git repo name (preferred) or directory basename
SLUG=$(basename "$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null | sed 's/\.git$//')" 2>/dev/null || basename "$PWD")
# Result: "pilot-shell", "my-api", "acme-backend"
```

Use `{slug}-` prefix on everything: `{slug}-project.md`, `{slug}-mcp-servers.md`, `{slug}-{topic}.md`, `.claude/skills/{slug}-{name}/`.

### Output Locations

**Custom rules** in `.claude/rules/`: `{slug}-project.md` (tech stack, structure), `{slug}-mcp-servers.md` (custom MCP servers), `{slug}-{pattern-name}.md` (tribal knowledge).

**Custom skills** in `.claude/skills/{slug}-{name}/SKILL.md`: workflows, tool integrations, domain expertise.

Use unique names (not `plan`, `implement`, `verify`, `standards-*`) for custom skills.

### Error Handling

| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Vexor not installed | Use Grep/Glob, skip indexing |
| No MCP servers | Skip MCP documentation |
| No README.md | Ask user for description |
| No package.json/pyproject.toml | Infer from file extensions |

### Writing Concise Rules

Rules load every session — every word costs tokens.

- **Lead with the rule** — what to do first, why second
- **Code examples over prose** — show, don't tell
- **Skip the obvious** — don't document standard framework behavior
- **One concept per rule** — don't combine unrelated patterns
- **Bullet points > paragraphs** — scannable beats readable
- **Max ~100 lines per file** — split large topics

---

## Phase 1: Read Existing Rules & Skills

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP.**

1. Derive the project slug (see Phase 0 → Project Slug)
2. `ls -la .claude/rules/*.md 2>/dev/null` — read each rule file
3. `ls -la .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null` — read each skill file
4. Check for legacy CLAUDE.md: `ls CLAUDE.md claude.md .claude.md 2>/dev/null` — read if found
5. **Detect unscoped legacy files** — look for `project.md`, `mcp-servers.md`, or any rule/skill without the `{slug}-` prefix. If found, flag them for migration in Phase 1.5.
6. Build mental inventory: documented rules, documented skills, CLAUDE.md contents (if any), potential gaps, possibly outdated items, legacy unscoped files

### Phase 1.5: Migrate Unscoped Assets — CONDITIONAL

**Only if Phase 1 found rules or skills without the `{slug}-` prefix** (e.g., `project.md` instead of `{slug}-project.md`, or `.claude/skills/my-skill/` instead of `.claude/skills/{slug}-my-skill/`).

AskUserQuestion: "Found unscoped assets that should be prefixed with '{slug}-' for better Team sharing. Migrate now?"
- **"Yes, migrate all"** — For each unscoped file: rename to `{slug}-{name}`, update any internal references. Delete the old file.
- **"Review each"** — Show each file, let user decide per-file.
- **"Skip"** — Leave as-is, continue sync.

**Migration rules:**
- `project.md` → `{slug}-project.md`
- `mcp-servers.md` → `{slug}-mcp-servers.md`
- `{topic}.md` → `{slug}-{topic}.md` (unless it's a Pilot-managed standard rule)
- `.claude/skills/{name}/` → `.claude/skills/{slug}-{name}/` (update `name:` in frontmatter too)
- Do NOT migrate files from `~/.claude/rules/` — those are global Pilot rules, not project-scoped

## Phase 2: Initialize Vexor Index

1. Check: `vexor --version` — if not installed, inform user, use Grep/Glob instead
2. Build index (use `timeout: 900000` for first run): `vexor index --path /absolute/path/to/project`
3. Verify: `vexor search "main entry point" --top 3`

> First-time indexing can take 5-15 minutes. Subsequent syncs are faster due to caching.

## Phase 3: Explore Codebase

1. **Directory structure:** `tree -L 3 -I 'node_modules|.git|__pycache__|dist|build|.venv|.next|coverage|.cache|cdk.out'`
2. **Technologies:** Check `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `tsconfig.json`, `go.mod`
3. **Vexor searches:** API patterns, test patterns, configuration, gaps from Phase 1
4. **Grep:** Response structures, naming conventions, import patterns
5. **Read** 5-10 representative files in key areas

## Phase 4: Compare & Identify Gaps

1. For each existing rule: still accurate? new patterns? tech stack changed? commands/paths correct?
2. Identify gaps: undocumented tribal knowledge, new conventions, changed patterns
3. AskUserQuestion to confirm findings: "Update all" | "Review each" | "Show details" | "Skip updates"

## Phase 5: Sync Project Rule

**Update `.claude/rules/{slug}-project.md` with current project state.**

Also look for a legacy unscoped `project.md` — if found, migrate its content into `{slug}-project.md` and delete the old file.

### Step 5.0: Handle Existing CLAUDE.md — CONDITIONAL

**Only if Phase 1 found a CLAUDE.md file (any variant).**

If both CLAUDE.md AND `{slug}-project.md` exist: read both, check for redundant content. If CLAUDE.md has unique content not in the project rule, offer to merge it in. If fully redundant, suggest removing CLAUDE.md.

If CLAUDE.md exists but NO `{slug}-project.md`: AskUserQuestion:
- "Migrate to modular rules (Recommended)" — Split CLAUDE.md into `.claude/rules/{slug}-project.md` + topic-specific rule files. Advantages: smaller context per session, topic-specific loading, survives Pilot updates, team-shareable via Teams dashboard.
- "Keep CLAUDE.md as-is" — Skip creating project rule. CLAUDE.md stays as the single source of project context.
- "Create project rule alongside CLAUDE.md" — Keep both. Project rule gets tech stack/structure, CLAUDE.md keeps custom instructions.

**If migrating:** Read CLAUDE.md, identify logical sections (project overview, tech stack, conventions, patterns, etc.). Create `{slug}-project.md` from overview/stack/structure sections. Create additional rule files for distinct topics (e.g., `{slug}-conventions.md`, `{slug}-api-patterns.md`). AskUserQuestion to confirm the split before writing. After writing, ask: "Remove CLAUDE.md?" | "Rename to CLAUDE.md.bak" | "Keep both".

### Step 5.1: Create or Update {slug}-project.md

If exists: compare tech stack, verify structure/commands, update timestamp, preserve custom sections.

If doesn't exist (and user didn't choose to keep CLAUDE.md only), create using this structure:

```markdown
# Project: [Name]

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## Overview
[Brief description from README or ask user]

## Technology Stack
- **Language / Framework / Build Tool / Testing / Package Manager**

## Directory Structure
[Simplified tree — key directories only]

## Key Files
- **Configuration / Entry Points / Tests**

## Development Commands
| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Install / Dev / Build / Test / Lint | `[command]` |

## Architecture Notes
[Brief patterns description]
```

## Phase 6: Sync MCP Rules

**Document user-configured MCP servers (skip Pilot core: context7, mem-search, web-search, web-fetch, grep-mcp).**

#### Step 6.1: Discover

Parse `.mcp.json`, exclude Pilot core servers.

#### Step 6.2: Smoke-Test

For each user server:
1. `ToolSearch(query="+server-name keyword")` to discover tools
2. Call each tool with minimal read-only arguments (**safety: only read-only tools**)
3. Record per-tool: success | auth error | connection error | schema error | timeout
4. Report health check:
   ```
   ✅ polar — 3/3 tools working
   ⚠️ typefully — 4/5 working, 1 permission error
   ❌ my-api — 0/2 working (connection refused)
   ```
5. If issues: AskUserQuestion "Document working tools only" | "Document all with status notes" | "Skip MCP sync"

#### Step 6.3: Document

Compare against existing `{slug}-mcp-servers.md`. If changes detected, ask user: "Update all" | "Review each" | "Skip"

Also look for a legacy unscoped `mcp-servers.md` — if found, migrate content into `{slug}-mcp-servers.md` and delete the old file.

#### Step 6.4: Write

Create/update `.claude/rules/{slug}-mcp-servers.md`:

```markdown
### [server-name]
**Source:** `.mcp.json`
**Purpose:** [Brief description]
**Status:** ✅ All working | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Broken

| Tool | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|

**Example:** `ToolSearch(query="+server-name keyword")` then call directly.
```

**Skip if:** no `.mcp.json`, only Pilot core servers, user declines.

## Phase 7: Sync Existing Skills

For each skill from Phase 1:
1. **Relevance:** Does the workflow/tool still exist? Has process changed?
2. **Currency:** Steps accurate? APIs changed? Examples working?
3. **Triggers:** Description still accurate for discovery?

If updates needed: AskUserQuestion (multiSelect) with what changed and why. For each selected: update content, bump version (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.0.1). Confirm each: "Yes, update it" | "Edit first" | "Skip this one".

If obsolete: AskUserQuestion "Yes, remove it" | "Keep it" | "Update instead". If removing: delete the skill directory.

## Phase 8: Discover New Rules

1. List undocumented areas (comparing Phase 1 + Phase 3)
2. Prioritize by: frequency, uniqueness, mistake likelihood
3. AskUserQuestion (multiSelect): which areas to document
4. For each: ask clarifying questions, draft rule, confirm before creating
5. Write to `.claude/rules/{slug}-{pattern-name}.md`

**Rule format:** Standard Name → When to Apply → The Pattern (code) → Why (if not obvious) → Common Mistakes → Good/Bad examples.

## Phase 9: Discover & Create Skills

Skills are appropriate for: multi-step workflows, tool integrations, reusable scripts, domain expertise.

1. Identify candidates from exploration: repeated workflows, complex tool usage, bundled scripts
2. AskUserQuestion (multiSelect): which to create
3. For each: invoke `Skill(skill="learn")` to handle creation
4. Verify: skill directory exists, SKILL.md has proper frontmatter

## Phase 10: Summary

Report: Vexor index status, rules updated, new rules created, skills updated, new skills created, skills removed, unchanged items.

Then offer: "Share via Teams dashboard" (direct user to Console Teams page) | "Discover more standards" | "Create more skills" | "Done"
