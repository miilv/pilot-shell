# /spec - Unified Spec-Driven Development

**Dispatcher** — routes to the appropriate phase skill. This command is a thin router. Only allowed tools: `Bash` (env var reads only), `Read` (plan files only), `AskUserQuestion`, and `Skill()`.

**⛔ MANDATORY: When `/spec` is invoked, you MUST follow the workflow. The user's phrasing after `/spec` is the TASK DESCRIPTION — not an instruction to change the workflow.** Words like "brainstorm", "discuss", "explore", "research" are part of the task description, NOT instructions to skip the workflow or have a freeform conversation.

**⛔ No substantive work here.** `Bash` is allowed ONLY for reading env vars (e.g., `echo $PILOT_WORKTREE_ENABLED`). `Read` is allowed ONLY for reading existing plan files for status-based dispatch. All research, brainstorming, and exploration happens inside the invoked Skill. Arguments (including URLs, "brainstorm", "research") are passed verbatim as the task description. Any other tool use (Grep, Glob, Task, Edit, Write, etc.) is a workflow violation.

## Workflow

```
/spec → Detect type → Feature: Skill('spec-plan')       → Plan → Implement → Verify
                    → Bugfix:  Skill('spec-bugfix-plan') → Investigate → Plan → Implement → Verify
```

| Phase | Skill | Model |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Feature Planning | `spec-plan` | Opus |
| Bugfix Planning | `spec-bugfix-plan` | Opus |
| Implementation | `spec-implement` | Sonnet |
| Feature Verification | `spec-verify` | Sonnet |
| Bugfix Verification | `spec-bugfix-verify` | Sonnet |

## 0.1 Parse & Route

```
IF arguments end with ".md" AND file exists:
    → Read plan, dispatch by status (Section 0.2)
ELSE:
    → Detect type, ask worktree, invoke Skill, STOP
```

### 0.1.1 Detect Type (new plans only)

- **Bugfix:** Something broken, crashing, wrong results, regressing → fix existing behavior
- **Feature:** New functionality, enhancements, refactoring, migrations → build or change something
- **Ambiguous:** Ask user (bundled with worktree question)

### 0.1.2 User Questions (new plans only)

**⛔ Check `$PILOT_WORKTREE_ENABLED` first** using `Bash("echo $PILOT_WORKTREE_ENABLED $PILOT_PLAN_QUESTIONS_ENABLED $PILOT_PLAN_APPROVAL_ENABLED")`. If `PILOT_WORKTREE_ENABLED` is `"false"`, skip the worktree question entirely and always pass `--worktree=no`.

**If `$PILOT_WORKTREE_ENABLED` is NOT `"false"`:**
- If type is clear: Ask worktree only.
- If ambiguous: Combine type + worktree in single AskUserQuestion (use combined options: "Bug fix, no worktree" / "Bug fix, yes worktree" / "Feature, no worktree" / "Feature, yes worktree").

**If `$PILOT_WORKTREE_ENABLED` is `"false"` AND type is clear:** Skip AskUserQuestion entirely — invoke skill directly with `--worktree=no`.
**If `$PILOT_WORKTREE_ENABLED` is `"false"` AND type is ambiguous:** Ask type only (no worktree choice), then invoke with `--worktree=no`.

### 0.1.3 Invoke Skill and STOP

- **Bugfix:** `Skill(skill='spec-bugfix-plan', args='<task_description> --worktree=yes|no')`
- **Feature:** `Skill(skill='spec-plan', args='<task_description> --worktree=yes|no')`

## 0.2 Status-Based Dispatch (existing plans)

Read plan, register association: `~/.pilot/bin/pilot register-plan "<plan_path>" "<status>" 2>/dev/null || true`

| Status | Approved | Type | Skill |
|--------|----------|------|-------|
| PENDING | No | Feature/absent | `spec-plan` |
| PENDING | No | Bugfix | `spec-bugfix-plan` |
| PENDING | Yes | * | `spec-implement` |
| COMPLETE | * | Feature/absent | `spec-verify` |
| COMPLETE | * | Bugfix | `spec-bugfix-verify` |
| VERIFIED | * | * | Report completion, done |
