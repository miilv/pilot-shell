## TL;DR

First, `cd` into your project folder, then run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxritter/claude-pilot/main/install.sh | bash
```

After installation, run `pilot` to launch Claude Pilot. Use `/sync` to load rules and `/spec` for planned features.

## The Problem

Claude Code writes code fast. But without structure, you get:

- **No tests** — Code ships without verification
- **Context decay** — Quality degrades as the context window fills
- **Session amnesia** — Every restart, you re-explain everything
- **Inconsistent results** — Same prompt, different outcomes

Sound familiar? Pilot fixes that with **21 rules, 7 automated hooks, 14 coding skills, 3 language servers, and 5 MCP servers** working together on every single edit.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Claude Subscription:** [Max](https://www.anthropic.com/max), [Team](https://claude.ai/pricing/team), or [Enterprise](https://www.anthropic.com/enterprise) recommended

**Choose your environment:**
- **Local Installation** — Install directly on your system using Homebrew. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL2).
- **Dev Container** — Pre-configured, isolated environment with all tools ready. No system conflicts and works on any OS.

### Installation

`cd` into your project folder, then run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxritter/claude-pilot/main/install.sh | bash
```

After installation, run `pilot` or `ccp` in your project folder to start Claude Pilot.

### Installing a Specific Version

If the current version has issues, you can install a specific stable version (see [releases](https://github.com/maxritter/claude-pilot/releases)):

```bash
export VERSION=6.2.0
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxritter/claude-pilot/main/install.sh | bash
```

---

## Usage

### Sync Rules & Skills

Run `/sync` to sync custom rules and skills with your codebase. This is an **11-phase process** that explores your codebase, builds a semantic search index, discovers undocumented patterns, updates project documentation, creates new skills, and optionally shares assets via Team Vault. Run it once initially, then anytime again:

```bash
pilot
> /sync
```

<details>
<summary><b>What <code>/sync</code> does in detail (11 phases)</b></summary>

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 0 | Load reference guidelines, output locations, error handling |
| 1 | Read existing rules and skills from `.claude/` |
| 2 | Build Vexor semantic search index (first run may take 5-15 min) |
| 3 | Explore codebase with Vexor/Grep to find patterns |
| 4 | Compare discovered vs documented patterns |
| 5 | Sync/update `project.md` with tech stack and commands |
| 6 | Sync MCP server documentation |
| 7 | Update existing skills that have changed |
| 8 | Discover and document new undocumented patterns as rules |
| 9 | Create new skills via `/learn` command |
| 10 | Share new assets via Team Vault (sx) |
| 11 | Report summary of all changes |

</details>

### Spec-Driven Mode

Best for complex features, refactoring, or when you want to review a plan before implementation:

```bash
pilot
> /spec "Add user authentication with OAuth and JWT tokens"
```

**How it works:**

```
Plan  →  Approve  →  Implement  →  Verify
                        ↑              ↓
                        └── Loop ──────┘
```

<details>
<summary><b>Plan Phase — what actually happens</b></summary>

1. Explores entire codebase with semantic search (Vexor)
2. Asks clarifying questions before committing to a design
3. Writes detailed spec to `docs/plans/` as reviewed markdown
4. Verifies plan logic for correctness before presenting
5. Waits for your approval — you can edit the plan first

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Implement Phase — what actually happens</b></summary>

1. Writes a failing test first (RED phase of TDD)
2. Implements code to make the test pass (GREEN phase)
3. Refactors while keeping tests green (REFACTOR phase)
4. Quality hooks auto-lint, format, and type-check every file edit
5. Updates plan checkboxes after each completed task
6. If context reaches 70%+, hands off to next session seamlessly

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Verify Phase — what actually happens</b></summary>

1. Runs full test suite — unit, integration, and E2E
2. Type checking across the entire project
3. **Verifier sub-agents** perform independent code review
4. Validates every plan task was actually completed
5. Loops back to implementation if any check fails

</details>

**Status-based dispatch** — running `/spec` on an existing plan automatically resumes at the right phase:

| Plan Status | Approved? | Action |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| PENDING | No | Run planning |
| PENDING | Yes | Run implementation |
| COMPLETE | * | Run verification |
| VERIFIED | * | Done |

### Quick Mode

Just chat. No plan file, no approval gate. All quality hooks and TDD enforcement still apply.

Best for bug fixes, small improvements, and exploratory work:

```bash
pilot
> Fix the null pointer bug in user.py
```

### Online Learning

Capture non-obvious discoveries as reusable skills. Triggered automatically after 10+ minute investigations, or manually:

```bash
pilot
> /learn "Extract the debugging workflow we used for the race condition"
```

**What triggers learning:**
- Non-obvious debugging (10+ minutes of investigation)
- Misleading error messages with discovered workarounds
- Tool integrations and configurations
- Repeatable workflows and patterns
- External service queries (Jira, GitHub, Confluence)

### Rules, Commands & Skills

Create your own rules, commands or skills in your project's `.claude/` folder:

| Type         | Loaded                            | Best for                                |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Rules**    | Every session (always in context) | Guidelines Claude should always follow  |
| **Commands** | On demand via `/command`          | Specific workflows or multi-step tasks  |
| **Skills**   | Dynamically when relevant         | Specialized knowledge for specific tasks |

Claude Pilot automatically installs best-practice rules, commands, and coding standard skills.

### Team Vault

Share rules, commands, and skills across your team via a private Git repository:

```bash
pilot
> /sync  # Configure team vault and sync assets
```

- **Private** - Use any Git repo (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket - public or private)
- **Pull** - Install shared assets from your team's vault
- **Push** - Share your custom rules and skills with teammates
- **Version** - Assets are versioned automatically (v1, v2, v3...)

### Custom MCP Servers

Add your own MCP servers in two locations:

| Config File | How It Works | Best For |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| `.mcp.json` | Instructions load into context when triggered | Lightweight servers (few tools) |
| `mcp_servers.json` | Called via mcp-cli; instructions never enter context | Heavy servers (many tools) |

Run `/sync` after adding servers to generate documentation.

---

## Under the Hood

Pilot isn't a thin wrapper or a prompt template — it's a deeply engineered system with layers of automation working together on every edit.

### The Hooks Pipeline

**7 hooks** fire automatically at every stage of development. Here's what runs and when:

#### SessionStart (on startup, clear, or compact)

| Hook | Type | What it does |
|------|------|-------------|
| Memory loader | Blocking | Loads persistent context from Pilot Console memory |
| Session tracker | Async | Initializes user message tracking for the session |

#### PostToolUse (after every Write / Edit / MultiEdit)

This is where most of the quality enforcement happens. After **every single file edit**, these hooks fire:

| Hook | Type | What it does |
|------|------|-------------|
| `file_checker_python.py` | Blocking | Runs ruff format + lint + basedpyright type checking on `.py` files. Auto-fixes formatting and common lint issues. |
| `file_checker_ts.py` | Blocking | Runs Prettier + ESLint + type checking on `.ts`/`.tsx` files. Auto-fixes formatting and common issues. |
| `file_checker_go.py` | Blocking | Runs gofmt + golangci-lint + type checking on `.go` files. Auto-fixes formatting. |
| `tdd_enforcer.py` | Non-blocking | Checks if implementation files were modified without failing tests first. Shows reminder to write tests. Excludes test files, docs, config, TSX, and infrastructure. |
| Memory observer | Async | Captures development observations to persistent memory. |
| `context_monitor.py` | Non-blocking | Monitors context window usage. Warns at 80%, forces handoff at 90%, emergency at 95%. Caches for 15 seconds to avoid spam. |

#### PreToolUse (before search, web, or task tools)

| Hook | Type | What it does |
|------|------|-------------|
| `tool_redirect.py` | Blocking | Routes WebSearch, WebFetch, Grep, Task, and plan mode tools to appropriate contexts. Prevents tools from being accidentally lost during plan/implement phases. |

#### Stop (when Claude tries to finish)

| Hook | Type | What it does |
|------|------|-------------|
| `spec_stop_guard.py` | Blocking | If an active spec exists with PENDING or COMPLETE status, **blocks stopping**. Forces verification to complete before the session can end. |
| Session summarizer | Async | Saves session observations to persistent memory for future sessions. |

### Context Monitor & Endless Mode

The context monitor tracks usage in real-time and manages multi-session continuity:

| Threshold | Level | Action |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **80%** | WARN | Prepare for continuation. Pilot saves state, wraps up current work, prepares handoff notes. |
| **90%** | CRITICAL | Mandatory handoff. Saves session state to `~/.pilot/sessions/`, writes continuation file, picks up seamlessly in new session. |
| **95%** | URGENT | Emergency handoff. All progress preserved — no work lost. |

**Key behaviors:**
- At 70%+ during `/spec`, Pilot won't start a new phase — it hands off to the next session
- Multiple Pilot sessions can run in parallel on the same project without interference
- Session state is stored in `~/.pilot/sessions/$PILOT_SESSION_ID/`
- 15-second TTL cache prevents repeated warnings from flooding output

### 21 Built-in Rules
